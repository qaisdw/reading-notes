Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh are all popular visualization libraries in Python, but they have different features and use cases:

1. Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a versatile and widely used library for creating static, interactive, and publication-quality visualizations. It provides low-level control over the creation of plots, allowing users to customize every aspect of the visualization. Matplotlib is suitable for a wide range of visualizations, from simple line plots to complex 3D visualizations. It is a foundational library that forms the basis for many other Python visualization libraries.

Example: Matplotlib is suitable for creating basic line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more. For example, you can use Matplotlib to plot a time series line graph showing the stock prices of a company over a specific period.

2. Seaborn: Seaborn is a high-level statistical visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a more concise and aesthetically pleasing API for creating informative and visually appealing statistical graphics. Seaborn simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations by providing default settings and specialized functions for common statistical plots.

Example: Seaborn is suitable for creating visualizations like box plots, violin plots, heatmaps, and regression plots. For example, you can use Seaborn to create a box plot that displays the distribution of salaries for different job positions in a company.

3. Bokeh: Bokeh is a library primarily designed for interactive and web-based visualizations. It focuses on providing interactive plots that can be explored and manipulated in web browsers. Bokeh allows for the creation of interactive dashboards, real-time streaming data visualizations, and interactive data applications.

Example: Bokeh is suitable for creating interactive visualizations like zoomable line plots, interactive scatter plots, and interactive maps. For example, you can use Bokeh to create an interactive scatter plot that allows users to hover over data points to see additional information.

In Seaborn, the main functions for creating different types of plots are:

1. Relational Plots: Seaborn provides functions like `scatterplot()`, `lineplot()`, and `relplot()` to create relational plots. These plots show the relationship between two or more variables and are useful for understanding patterns, correlations, and trends in the data.

2. Categorical Plots: Seaborn offers functions such as `barplot()`, `countplot()`, `boxplot()`, and `violinplot()` to create categorical plots. These plots are used to visualize categorical data and display distributions, comparisons, or relationships between categories.

3. Distribution Plots: Seaborn provides functions like `histplot()`, `kdeplot()`, `distplot()`, and `rugplot()` to create distribution plots. These plots help visualize the distribution of a single variable or compare the distributions of multiple variables.

The Seaborn Cheat Sheet serves as a quick reference guide for Python developers working with Seaborn. It provides an overview of the most commonly used functions and features in Seaborn, organized into sections such as plot types, statistical functions, color palettes, and more. The cheat sheet helps developers quickly find the appropriate Seaborn function for a specific visualization task without having to consult the documentation extensively. It showcases the syntax, parameters, and examples, making it easier to understand and implement Seaborn functionalities efficiently.
