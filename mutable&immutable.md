## The difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.


**In Python, data types can be classified as mutable or immutable.Mutable data types are those that can be changed after they are created,
while immutable data types are those that cannot be changed once they are created.**

**Immutable data types include integers, floats, complex numbers, and strings. Once an immutable object is created, it cannot be modified.
Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object with the new value, leaving the original object unchanged.**

**On the other hand, mutable data types include lists, dictionaries, and sets. Mutable objects can be modified after they are created,
and any changes made to a mutable object will affect all references to that object. For example,
if a list is modified in one part of a program, any other part of the program that references that list will see the updated version.**

**It is important to keep the difference between mutable and immutable data types in mind when working with Python.
When passing arguments to functions, immutable objects are typically passed by value, while mutable objects are passed by reference.
Understanding this difference can help prevent unexpected behavior in your code.**
