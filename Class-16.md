1. Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider dynamically manages and allocates server resources based on the demand of individual functions or applications. Key characteristics of serverless computing include:

- No server management: With serverless, developers do not need to worry about provisioning, scaling, or maintaining servers. The cloud provider handles all the server infrastructure management.
- Event-driven architecture: Serverless functions are triggered by events or requests, such as HTTP requests, database updates, or scheduled tasks.
- Automatic scaling: Serverless platforms automatically scale the resources allocated to a function based on the incoming workload. Functions can scale from zero to handle thousands of concurrent requests.
- Pay-per-use pricing: With serverless, you are billed based on the actual usage of your functions or applications, rather than paying for idle resources.

In contrast, traditional server-based architectures involve managing and provisioning servers to host and run applications. Developers have to allocate and maintain the necessary infrastructure, such as servers, load balancers, and scaling mechanisms.

2. To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function, follow these main steps:

Step 1: Set up a Vercel account: Sign up for an account on Vercel's website (vercel.com) and install the Vercel CLI (Command-Line Interface) on your local machine.

Step 2: Create a new project: Use the Vercel CLI to create a new project in your desired directory.

Step 3: Write the serverless function: Create a new file for your serverless function and write the code for the desired functionality. Serverless functions in Vercel can be written using Node.js, Python, or other supported languages.

Step 4: Deploy the function: Use the Vercel CLI to deploy your serverless function to the Vercel platform. The CLI will guide you through the deployment process, including providing necessary configuration options.

Step 5: Test and monitor: Once deployed, you can test your serverless function and monitor its performance using the Vercel dashboard and logs.

3. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs provide a way to access and manipulate data or services provided by external sources, such as web servers, databases, or online platforms.

In Python applications, APIs can be utilized to interact with external sources by sending HTTP requests to specific endpoints and receiving responses in various formats like JSON, XML, or HTML. By making API calls, you can retrieve data, send data, or perform specific actions on the external resources.

4. The Requests library in Python is a popular HTTP library that simplifies making HTTP requests. It provides a high-level interface to interact with APIs and supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. The Requests library handles the complexities of sending HTTP requests and handling responses, including handling authentication, headers, cookies, and session management.

Here's an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library:

```python
import requests

# Send a GET request to an API endpoint
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

# Check the response status code
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Request was successful
    data = response.json()  # Get the response data in JSON format
    print(data)
else:
    # Request encountered an error
    print('Request failed with status code:', response.status_code)
```

In this example, a GET request is made to the URL 'https://api.example.com/data'. The response is then checked for a successful status code (200), and the response data is retrieved and printed. The Requests library makes it straightforward to interact with APIs and handle the HTTP requests and responses effectively.
