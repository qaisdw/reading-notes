**Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python.
What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?**

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly to solve a problem.
It involves breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems and solving them recursively until a base case is reached.

**For example**, the problem of calculating the factorial of a number.
The factorial of a number n is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
To calculate the factorial of a number, we can use a recursive function as follows:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

```
Where this function first checks if the input n is zero, which is the base case. If n is zero, the function returns 1.
Otherwise, it returns n multiplied by the result of calling factorial with n-1. This process continues recursively until the base case is reached.


**Some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function include:**

- Always define a base case that will terminate the recursion.
- Ensure that the recursive function converges towards the base case.
- Avoid using recursion for large or deeply nested problems as it can cause a stack overflow.
- Use memoization to avoid redundant computations when solving problems recursively.
