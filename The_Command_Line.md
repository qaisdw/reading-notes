# The Command Line


The command line is a way to interact with a computer by typing commands instead of clicking on icons.
It's a text-based interface that runs in a program called a terminal. The most common shell used in the terminal is called bash.
You can open a terminal on your computer and start typing commands to perform various tasks.
There are many shortcuts you can use in the terminal to make things easier.

The Linux directory system is a hierarchy starting with the root directory,
denoted by "/". To navigate it, you need to use the command line interface. 

In Linux, files and directories have some interesting characteristics:

1. Almost everything is treated as a file, including hardware devices.
2. Files and directories starting with a dot (.) are hidden.
3. Every file and directory has permissions that determine who can access and modify them.
4. Each file and directory is owned by a specific user and group.
5. Files are identified by their type, such as ASCII text or binary.
6. File extensions can be used to help identify file contents, but are not necessary for file type determination.

In Linux, you can use the manual pages (or "man pages") to learn about how to use commands and other system functions.
Here are some tips to help you make the most of the manual pages:

1. To access a manual page, type "man" followed by the command name.
2. Use arrow keys or "j" and "k" keys to navigate the page, and "/" to search for specific text.
3. Manual pages are divided into sections based on their content, such as user commands or system calls.
4. Many manual pages include examples of how to use the command effectively.
5. Pay attention to the syntax and formatting of the command examples to avoid errors when using the command.

In Linux, you can use commands to manipulate files and directories.

**cheat sheet:**

1. Linux file system starts at the root directory: "/".
2. You can manipulate files and directories using commands like "touch", "rm", "mv", "cp", and "mkdir".
3. Use the "man" command to access the manual pages for help on commands.
4. Files and directories have properties like permissions, ownership, and timestamps.
5. You can check these properties using commands like "ls -l" and "stat".
6. Wildcards like "*" and "?" can be used to match multiple files at once.
7. Use the "Tab" key for auto-completion of commands and file names.
