## Jupyter Lab vs. Jupyter Notebook:

**Jupyter Lab** is an enhanced version of Jupyter Notebook, providing a more interactive and flexible environment for data analysis,
visualization, and coding. Here are some key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab compared to Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Notebook interface:** Jupyter Lab retains the notebook interface of Jupyter Notebook, allowing you to write and execute code cells, create markdown cells,
   and mix code, text, and visualizations in a single document.
2. **Flexible workspace:** Jupyter Lab provides a multi-tab interface where you can arrange notebooks, code consoles, terminals, text editors, file browsers,
   and other components in a flexible manner. This enables you to work with multiple files and notebooks simultaneously and easily customize your workspace layout.
3. **Rich text editing:** Jupyter Lab offers enhanced text editing capabilities, including syntax highlighting, code folding, and multiple cursors.
   It also supports rich text editing with Markdown, LaTeX equations, HTML, and images.
4. **Extensions and plug-ins:** Jupyter Lab supports a modular architecture that allows you to extend its functionality with custom extensions and plug-ins.
   There is a wide range of community-contributed extensions available, such as interactive visualizations, debugging tools, and version control integrations.
5. **Integration with other tools:** Jupyter Lab seamlessly integrates with other popular data science libraries and tools, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib,
    and scikit-learn. It provides a unified environment for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
6. **File management:** Jupyter Lab includes a built-in file browser that allows you to navigate, open, and manage files and directories directly within the interface.
    You can also use the terminal component to execute system commands.
7. **Version control:** Jupyter Lab integrates with version control systems like Git, making it easier to track changes and collaborate with others on notebooks 
    and code projects.

In summary, Jupyter Lab expands on the features of Jupyter Notebook by offering a more flexible and integrated environment for data analysis,
coding, and collaboration.

## NumPy library and its functionalities:
**NumPy (Numerical Python)** is a powerful library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is a fundamental library for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks.
Some of its main functionalities are:

1. **N-dimensional array:** NumPy introduces the ndarray object, which represents a multi-dimensional array of elements of the same data type.
    This allows efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets, such as images, audio, or numerical data.
2. **Mathematical operations:** NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions and operators that can be applied element-wise on arrays,
    including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, exponential functions, and more. These operations can be
    performed efficiently on arrays, resulting in improved performance compared to traditional Python lists.
3. **Broadcasting:** NumPy's broadcasting feature enables arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes.
    It automatically aligns the arrays' dimensions to perform element-wise operations, eliminating the need for explicit loops.
4. **Array indexing and slicing:** NumPy supports powerful indexing and slicing operations, allowing you to access and manipulate subsets of array data efficiently.
    You can extract specific elements, rows, columns, or sub-arrays based on indices or conditional expressions.
5. **Linear algebra operations:** NumPy provides a comprehensive set of linear algebra functions, such as matrix multiplication,
    matrix decomposition (e.g., LU, QR, and Cholesky), eigenvalues and eigenvectors, solving linear systems of equations, and more.
    These operations are essential for many scientific and numerical computations.
6. **Random number generation:** NumPy includes a random number generation module that allows you to generate random numbers from various probability distributions,
    such as uniform, normal, exponential, and more. This is useful for simulations, statistical analysis, and modeling.
7. **Data manipulation:** NumPy provides functions for reshaping, sorting, searching, stacking, splitting, and merging arrays.
    These operations are crucial for data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation tasks in scientific computing and data analysis.

## NumPy array structure, creation, manipulation, and operations:
**Array creation:** You can create a NumPy array by passing a Python list, tuple, or any iterable object to the numpy.array() function. For example:
```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5]

```
**Array properties:** NumPy arrays have properties like shape (dimensions of the array), dtype (data type of the elements),
and size (total number of elements). You can access these properties using the array's attributes. For example:
```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr.shape)  # Output: (5,)
print(arr.dtype)  # Output: int64
print(arr.size)  # Output: 5
```

**Array indexing and slicing:** NumPy arrays support indexing and slicing operations similar to Python lists.
You can access individual elements or extract subsets of the array using square brackets. For example:
```python 
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr[0])  # Output: 1
print(arr[1:4])  # Output: [2 3 4]
```

**Array manipulation:** NumPy provides various functions to manipulate arrays, such as reshaping, concatenating, splitting, and sorting. For example:
```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape(3, 2)
print(reshaped_arr)
# Output:
# [[1 2]
#  [3 4]
#  [5 6]]

concatenated_arr = np.concatenate((arr, reshaped_arr), axis=0)
print(concatenated_arr)
# Output:
# [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]
#  [1 2]
#  [3 4]
#  [5 6]]

sorted_arr = np.sort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)
# Output:
# [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]]

```
**Array operations:** NumPy allows performing various mathematical operations on arrays, such as element-wise arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions,
statistical functions, and linear algebra operations. These operations can be applied to entire arrays or specific axes. For example:
```python
import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

sum_arr = arr1 + arr2
print(sum_arr)  # Output: [5 7 9]

sin_arr1 = np.sin(arr1)
print(sin_arr1)  # Output: [0.84147098 0.90929743 0.14112001]

mean_arr2 = np.mean(arr2)
print(mean_arr2)  # Output: 5.0

```
