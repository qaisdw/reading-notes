# Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA)

**1-1-Selecting the most suitable data structure to solve a problem requires careful consideration of the time complexity and efficiency of frequently performed operations.
The choice of data structure can significantly impact the overall performance and speed of the algorithm.**

**2-When implementing a recursive function, it is vital to establish a base case or stopping condition to prevent an infinite recursive call stack.
A base case refers to a straightforward problem that can be solved without further recursion. By providing a base case, the function will eventually stop calling itself,
thus preventing an infinite loop and avoiding potential stack overflow errors.It is also crucial to ensure that the recursive function makes progress towards the base case
with each recursive call, leading to a solution.**
