**What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code?
Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.**

Pytest fixtures are functions that provide a fixed baseline for tests.
They are used to set up and tear down a test environment, provide test data, or perform other actions that are required for testing.
Fixtures help to avoid repetitive code and make testing more efficient.

Code coverage, on the other hand, is a measure of how much of the code is executed during testing.
It helps to identify untested or poorly tested parts of the code, ensuring that the codebase is thoroughly tested and reducing the risk of bugs.

**Using fixtures and code coverage together in testing Python code can improve the quality and maintainability of a project by ensuring that:**

1. Tests are repeatable and consistent across different environments.
2. Code coverage reports can identify parts of the codebase that are not tested,
   enabling developers to write more comprehensive tests.
3. Fixtures can be used to reduce code duplication, making tests more efficient and easier to maintain.
4. Code coverage can help to identify potential areas of improvement in the codebase,
   allowing developers to focus on areas that need the most attention.

To use fixtures and code coverage together in testing Python code, developers can use pytest fixtures to set up the test environment, generate test data,
and perform other actions required for testing. Code coverage tools such as coverage.py can be used to measure the code coverage
during testing and generate reports that highlight untested or poorly tested parts of the code. By using fixtures and code coverage together, 
developers can ensure that their tests are reliable, comprehensive, and maintainable.
