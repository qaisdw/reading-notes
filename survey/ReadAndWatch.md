# Alain de Botton on Redefining Success. Main Points
1. Our society is obsessed with success and often defines it narrowly in terms of wealth and status.
2. We often assume that success is solely earned through hard work and talent, and that failure is solely a result of laziness or lack of ability.
3. These assumptions are flawed and overlook the role of luck and external circumstances in determining success and failure.
4. Instead of focusing solely on external markers of success, we should strive to find pleasure and meaning in our work regardless of how it is perceived by others.
5. We should also develop a more empathetic and understanding attitude towards those who have experienced failure or setbacks,
recognizing that they may have faced obstacles outside of their control.
