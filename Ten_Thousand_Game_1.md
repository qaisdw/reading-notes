# Random Functions in Python :-
The random module in Python offers several functions for generating random numbers or making selections from a list. These functions include:
- **`randint(a, b)`**: Returns a random integer between a and b, inclusive.
- **`random()`**: Returns a random float between 0 and 1.
- **`choice(seq)`**: Returns a random element from the given sequence.
- **`shuffle(seq)`**: Shuffles the elements of the given sequence in place.
- **`randrange(start, stop, step)`**: Returns a randomly selected element from the range(start, stop, step).

# What is Risk Analysis :-
Risk analysis is a critical process in software development that involves identifying, evaluating,
and prioritizing risks that could impact the success of a project.
**The key steps in conducting a risk analysis for a software project include:**
- Identifying potential risks that could affect the project's success.
- Assessing the likelihood and potential impact of each risk.
- Prioritizing the risks based on their likelihood and potential impact.
- Developing a plan to mitigate or manage the identified risks.


# Test Coverage :-
Test coverage is a metric used in software testing to measure the percentage of code that is executed by tests.
It provides valuable insight into the effectiveness of the testing process and can help identify areas of the code that may require additional testing.
**However,** test coverage can be a misleading metric as it only measures the extent to which code is executed by tests 
and does not necessarily guarantee that the code is correct or that all possible scenarios have been tested.


# Big O Notation :-
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the performance of an algorithm.
It describes how the time or space required to execute an algorithm grows as the input size increases. For example,
searching for a specific book on a bookshelf with n books has a time complexity of O(n).
This means that the time it takes to find the book increases linearly with the number of books on the shelf.

# Note :- 
**"Increases linearly"** means that the relationship between the input size and the time or space required to execute the algorithm is proportional.
So, if the input size increases by a certain amount, the time or space required will also increase by a proportional amount.
In other words, if the input size doubles, the time or space required will also double.
