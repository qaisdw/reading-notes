## Beginners Guide to Big O

**After reading the article "A Beginner's Guide to Big O Notation," it can be concluded that Big O notation is used in computer science to describe the performance
or complexity of an algorithm. Specifically, it is used to describe the worst-case scenario of an algorithm's execution time or space used.**

**The article explains different orders of growth, such as O(1), O(N), O(N²), and O(2^N).
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time or space regardless of the size of the input data set.
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set,
and O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.**

**The article also discusses logarithms and provides an example of binary search,which is an algorithm used to search sorted data sets.
Binary search is described as O(log N) because the iterative halving of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at 
the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase.**

**In conclusion, a grasp of Big O notation is important when dealing with algorithms that need to operate at scale,
allowing programmers to make the correct choices and acknowledge trade-offs when working with different data sets.**
