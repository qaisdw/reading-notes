## My understanding of relational databases and SQL.

**Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns, and SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate this data.
SQL allows users to create, modify, and retrieve data from relational databases through commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
Relational databases and SQL are widely used in business and enterprise applications to manage large volumes of data efficiently and securely.**
