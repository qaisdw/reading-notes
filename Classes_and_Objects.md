**What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python,
and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?**

In Python, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.
The key differences between classes and objects are:

1. Definition: A class is defined using the `class` keyword and consists of methods, properties, and attributes, while an object is an instance of a class.

2. Memory allocation: When a class is defined, it does not occupy any memory space.
   However, when an object is created, memory is allocated to store its properties and methods.

3. Creation: To create an object, you need to instantiate the class. This is done by calling the class name followed by parentheses,
   which creates a new object and returns a reference to it.

4. Properties and methods: A class can have properties, which are variables that store data, and methods,
   which are functions that perform actions. An object can access these properties and methods by using the dot notation.

5. Inheritance: A class can inherit properties and methods from another class, while an object cannot.

In Python, classes are used to create custom data types and define their behavior.
Objects are used to store and manipulate data, and to call methods defined in the class.
To create and manage instances of a class, you can use class constructors,
which are special methods that are called when a new object is created,
or you can use instance methods, which are methods that operate on a specific instance of a class.
